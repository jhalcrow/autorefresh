This is a simple http server that pushes notifications that the
files that it is serving have changed.  To use, first change to 
the directory where your files are then run refreshServer.py there

Then in the html file that you want to use to monitor for refresh
notifications add

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/refresher.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.onload = function() { pollForRefresh('/refreshMonitor') };
</script>

Finally navigate to http://localhost:8000/name_of_file.html
